- **Database Structure**: SQLite with proper migrations for residences, rooms, persons, users
- **LiveView Architecture**: Modern real-time interface
- **Server Running**: Currently accessible at http://localhost:4000

## Data Models
### Residences (✅ Working)
- Binary ID primary keys
- Title, address, floor_count, logo (binary)
- CRUD operations via ResidenceLive

### Rooms (✅ Working)

- Title, floor, needs_fob, memo, accepts_guests
- Belongs to residence
- CRUD operations via RoomsLive

### Persons (✅ Schema, ❌ No UI Yet)

- Purpose of visit, check in/out times
- Visitor type, status, memo
- Belongs to room

### Users (✅ Working)
- Complete authentication system

- Session management

## Current UI State
- **Landing Page**: Luxury property management interface with "Create Your First Property" call-to-action
- **Navigation**: Clean header with TrackGuests branding, auth links, guest check-in button
- **Theme**: Forced to light theme, luxury platinum/gradient styling
- **Empty State**: Shows welcome message since no residences exist yet

## What's Missing/Needs Work
1. **Guest Check-In/Out Flow**: Routes exist but LiveViews need implementation
2. **Person Management**: Schema exists but no CRUD interface
3. **Actual Guest Tracking**: The core workflow isn't fully connected
4. **Data Seeding**: No sample data to demonstrate functionality
5. **Navigation Flow**: Residences → Rooms → Guests hierarchy needs refinement

## Technical Stack
- Phoenix 1.7.18 with LiveView
- Ecto with SQLite 
- Tailwind CSS with daisyUI
- Binary UUID primary keys throughout
- Modern authentication with bcrypt

## Next Steps Opportunities
1. Implement the visitor check-in/check-out LiveViews
2. Create person management interface
3. Add sample data/seeding
4. Complete the guest tracking workflow
5. Enhance navigation between residences → rooms → guests
6. Add real-time features with PubSub for live guest tracking

The application has excellent foundations and beautiful design - it just needs the core guest tracking features completed!
